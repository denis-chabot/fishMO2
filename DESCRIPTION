Description: Functions to calculate and plot the standard metabolic rate (SMR)
    of fishes and invertebrates (but it should work for air-breathing animals
    also) from experiments yielding multiple measurements of oxygen consumption
    (MO2) over time. If the experiment includes a phase where dissolved oxygen
    (DO) was progressively decreased in the respirometer, functions to calculate
    and plot O2crit are included. If the experiment includes a phase when the
    animal was fed, the Specific Dynamic Action (SDA) can be calculated and
    illustrated. Finally, functions to calculate the solubility of oxygen in
    water and to convert between different units of DO are provided.
